#   --target evidence → twillingate-evidence   (dashboards)
#
# The ingestion image is the internet-facing one and carries nothing but the
# binary. Evidence needs a Node toolchain at *runtime* — it is a static site
# generator that bakes query results in at build time, so the site is rebuilt
# whenever the data changes — which is why it is packaged separately.

# Build stage must satisfy the toolchain floor in go.mod; bumping go.mod
# without bumping this tag fails the build rather than silently degrading.
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM pins this stage to the native runner and lets Go
# cross-compile to TARGET*, instead of QEMU emulating the compiler itself. The
# binary is CGO_ENABLED=0, so there is no C toolchain to cross-target. Building
# arm64/arm under emulation cost ~11 min per release against ~80s natively.
