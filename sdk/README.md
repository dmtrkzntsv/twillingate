# twillingate SDK source

TypeScript source of the JS SDK the collector serves at `/js/twillingate.js`.
The build output is **committed** at `internal/server/twillingate.js` and
embedded into the Go binary, so building the collector never needs Node.

```bash
npm ci
npm test           # vitest (jsdom)
npm run typecheck
npm run build      # rewrites ../internal/server/twillingate.js — commit it
```

CI rebuilds the bundle and fails on any diff against the committed file, so
every source change must ship with a fresh `npm run build`.

The committed bundle carries two placeholders: `__TWILLINGATE_VERSION__`,
substituted once at startup with the build version, and
`__TWILLINGATE_URL__`, substituted per request with the origin the file
was requested from. The served file is the only way to load the SDK;
bundling `src/twillingate.ts` leaves the origin placeholder in place and
the SDK stays dormant. Tests mock `src/origin.ts` to supply an origin.

The user-facing API reference and the wire format the SDK speaks both live
in [docs/twillingate.md](../docs/twillingate.md).
This bundle is the only client the collector serves.
