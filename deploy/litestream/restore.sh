# Restore the backup from object storage into a local copy and verify it: the
# backup drill in docs/deployment.md, run by hand or on a schedule.
#
# The restore never writes to REPLICA_PATH directly. A failed download, a
# truncated file, a corrupt database or one with no twillingate schema in it
# leaves the previous copy in place and exits non-zero, so a broken backup is
# reported rather than replacing a good copy with nothing.
#
# Environment:
#   SOURCE_DB     path of the database *on the writer* — litestream keys a
#                 replica by it, so this must match the `path:` in
#                 litestream.yml exactly (default /var/lib/twillingate/twillingate.db)
#   REPLICA_PATH  where to put the local copy (default /var/lib/twillingate/replica.db)
#   LITESTREAM_CONFIG  config file (default /etc/litestream.yml)
#   LOOP_INTERVAL seconds between runs; unset means run once and exit, which
#                 is what cron wants
#
# Requires: litestream, sqlite3, flock.
