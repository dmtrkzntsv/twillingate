// agent needs to set up a project, get it tracking and answer questions
// from the data; Deployment is what an operator needs to run the collector
// on their own server. Both are served over MCP, so the bytes an agent
// reads are the bytes a person reads. docs_sync_test.go binds
// Twillingate's reserved-key and tool lists to the source they describe.

// Reporting is the third contract page: how an agent builds the
// dashboards /app/ shows. docs_sync_test.go binds its component table to
// the UI's manifest and its tool and route tables to the registered ones.
