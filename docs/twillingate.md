# twillingate

What an AI agent — or a person — needs to set up a project, get a site or
app sending data, and answer questions from what comes back. The MCP
endpoint serves this file verbatim as `docs://twillingate`.

Installing twillingate on a server, configuring the collector itself,
standing up Evidence reporting, enabling the API endpoint and replicating
the database are the operator's job, in [deployment.md](deployment.md).

## What twillingate is

One Go binary and one SQLite file. It collects three kinds of analytics
through a single endpoint — web pageviews, native app screen views, and
custom product events — rolls them up nightly, and exposes the result three
ways: Evidence dashboards, a read-only SQL surface, and the API (MCP or
HTTP) an AI agent can query in plain language.

It is cookieless by default. An `anonymous` project never writes to a
visitor's device and salts every identifier with a key that rotates at
midnight, so nothing links across days. Raw IP addresses and User-Agent
strings are never stored — they are enriched into a country and a browser
name at ingest and discarded.

The pieces:

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `twillingate serve -ingest` | Ingestion: `POST /ingest/events`, the SDK at `/js/twillingate.js`, `/healthz` |
| `twillingate serve -api` | The API endpoint: MCP at `/mcp`, REST at `/api/` |
| `twillingate serve` | Both, on one listener unless `API_ADDR` says otherwise |
| `twillingate dashboards` | Renders the Evidence site from the database |
| `twillingate project`, `key`, `config` | Registry management |
| `twillingate migrate` | Applies schema migrations and exits |

Which of those run, and how they are configured, is set by the operator —
see [Configure the collector](deployment.md#configure-the-collector).

## Set up a project

Projects live in the database — a registry table, not a file — and are
managed either through the CLI or, over the API (MCP or HTTP), through the
management tools. Every operation has both forms:

| Operation | CLI | MCP tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create a project | `twillingate project create` | `create_project` |
| Change one | `twillingate project update` | `update_project` |
| List them | `twillingate project list` | `list_projects` |
| Archive / restore | `twillingate project archive` / `restore` | `archive_project` / `restore_project` |
| Rename | `twillingate project rename` | **none — CLI only** |
| Issue an ingest key | `twillingate key issue` | `issue_ingest_key` |
| List keys | `twillingate key list` | `list_ingest_keys` |
| Disable / enable a key | `twillingate key disable` / `enable` | `disable_ingest_key` / `enable_ingest_key` |
| Export / import the registry | `twillingate config export` / `import` | **none — CLI only** |
| Get paste-ready setup | — | `integration_guide` |

`create_project` and `update_project` take the project fields below as
`{alias, name, identity, allowed_origins, attributes}`; `create_project`
also takes `skip_key: true` to *not* issue a first key. `issue_ingest_key`
takes `{project, label}` and returns the key **and** a paste-ready snippet.
`integration_guide` takes `{project, platform}` where platform is `web`,
`spa`, `server` or `mobile`, and returns the whole setup as markdown with
the project's live key and identity mode already filled in — reach for it
before hand-assembling a snippet.

**Confirm the collector hostname before pasting.** A collector can answer
on several hostnames, and snippets use the default (`PUBLIC_URL`). Ask the
user which one this site should use and change the snippet's `src` if it
differs — the SDK posts to the origin it was loaded from.

Renaming and registry import/export have no MCP tool: both rewrite every
table in one transaction, which is not something to hand to an agent. Ask
the operator to run them.

The CLI forms:

```bash
twillingate project create -alias myapp -name "My App" -identity anonymous \
  -origin https://myapp.com -attr plan -attr tier
twillingate project list
twillingate project update -alias myapp -origin https://myapp.com -origin https://www.myapp.com
twillingate project rename -alias oldname -to newname   # data and ingest keys follow
twillingate project archive -alias myapp                # reversible: `project restore`
twillingate key issue -project myapp -label web
twillingate key list -project myapp
twillingate key disable -project myapp -label ios-2025
```

`project update` (and the `update_project` MCP tool) merge rather than
replace: a field you omit keeps its current value. `-origin` is the
exception — supplying it at all replaces the whole origins list. Neither can
clear origins to an empty list (empty is treated as "not supplied"); to do
that, edit the origins to `[]` in a `config export` dump and `config import`
it back.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `alias` | Internal key: the `project` column on every stored row and the dashboard label. Never transmitted. New aliases must match `^[a-z0-9]+$` — `blog`, `blog2`, `2048` are fine; `my_app` and `shop-uk` are not. Immutable once created; change one with `twillingate project rename`, which rewrites the `project` column across every table in one transaction. Ingest keys follow the rename, so deployed clients keep working. An alias created before this rule keeps working. |
| `name` | Display name. |
| `identity` | `anonymous` (default) or `identified`. |
| `ingest_keys` | One or more `{key, label, disabled}` credentials. Required. |
| `allowed_origins` | Origins allowed to post for this project. `*` is a wildcard — `https://*.example.com` covers every subdomain, a bare `*` allows any origin. Add `tauri://localhost` or `app://.` for Electron/Tauri. |
| `retention` | Per-project override of any retention window. |
| `attributes` | Custom product-event attribute keys to break down. |

`retention` is not a CLI flag — set it through `twillingate config export`
(dumps every project as JSON) and `twillingate config import FILE` (upserts
from that JSON, or from a pre-upgrade `projects.json`, detecting the legacy
bare-array format automatically). Import never archives or deletes anything
absent from the file, so a partial edit is safe. Overrides are field-level:

```json
"retention": { "web": { "raw_days": 90 } }
```

### Attribute breakdowns

A project declares which product-event attribute keys are worth reporting on:

```bash
twillingate project update -alias myapp -attr plan -attr tier
```

`-attr` is repeatable and, like `-origin`, replaces the whole list when
supplied. Declaring a key drives two things: its own `attr_*` column in
`v_events_flat`, and a value breakdown (counts and unique users per distinct
value, per event, per day) in `agg_product_attrs` / `v_product_attrs`.

Everything sent is still stored regardless. An undeclared key has no
dedicated column but stays reachable via `json_extract(attributes,
'$.junk')`; declaring a key later does not backfill. Rollups run
unconditionally — a project with no `attributes` still gets daily counts and
totals, it just has nothing to break down.

Declaring a key bounds columns, not the values inside one. An
unbounded-cardinality key like a URL or session id would make the aggregate
grow as fast as the raw data it summarises, defeating retention.
`PRODUCT_ATTRIBUTES_TOP_N` (default 50, set
[server-side](deployment.md#configure-the-collector)) guards that globally:
only the top N
values per key are kept and the rest collapse into one `(other)` row whose
unique-user count is recomputed from raw rather than summed. A client
sending the literal string `(other)` collides with that bucket and loses its
own count — avoid that value.

`$platform` and `$app_version` roll up automatically without being declared.
Do not add them to `attributes`: `$`-prefixed keys are reserved and never
reach the custom attribute blob, so `"attributes": ["$platform"]` extracts
nothing.

### Ingest keys

A project needs at least one key, and the key identifies the project — no
payload carries a project field. Multiple keys let a website, an iOS app and
a desktop app be retired on their own schedules.

Keys are **public by design** — they ship in app binaries and page source —
so their job is revocation and project identification, not secrecy. To
retire one: add the replacement, ship clients, watch the old label fall to
zero in the per-minute `ingest summary` log line, then disable it. Deleting
the entry is the eventual cleanup; the flag keeps the step reversible during
a botched rollout.

## Instrument a website

The collector serves its own SDK at `/js/twillingate.js`, compiled from the
TypeScript in `sdk/` and embedded in the binary. One file, two modes: a
drop-in snippet, and a full SDK for driving web, product and app analytics
from code.

### Snippet mode

```html
<script defer src="https://twillingate.example.com/js/twillingate.js"
        data-key="ak_9f3c…"
        data-identity="anonymous"></script>
```

`twillingate key issue -project <alias> -label <label>` mints the key and
prints this snippet ready to paste. Its `src` uses `PUBLIC_URL`; change
the origin if this site uses another collector hostname.

| Attribute | `init()` option | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data-key` | `key` | The project's ingest key. Required; public by design. |
| `data-identity` | `identity` | `anonymous` (default) or `identified`. Mirrors the project's server-side mode; the server enforces the real one regardless. `identified` additionally authorizes persisting a visitor id in localStorage — consent-relevant under ePrivacy, the same category as a cookie. |
| `data-user`, `data-group` | `user`, `group` | Set when the page is rendered already knowing who is looking at it. |
| `data-auto="off"` | `autoPageviews` | Disable automatic pageviews; drive them with `twillingate.page()`. |
| `data-mask-url` | `maskUrl` | Rewrite the URL before it is sent. See [Masking](#masking-urls). |
| `data-routing` | `routing` | `history` (default) or `hash`. See [Hash routing](#hash-routing). |

**Every `data-*` attribute has an `init()` equivalent**, enforced by a test.
The reverse does not hold: `url`, `platform`, `appVersion`, `installId` and
`flushInterval` are code-only, because an attribute can only carry a string.

Pageviews are automatic, including on `history.pushState` and `popstate`, so
single-page apps need no extra code.

Include the tag once. If a second copy loads with the same `data-key`, or
with none, it leaves the first instance in place and logs a console warning,
so the page isn't counted twice. A second copy with a *different* key
replaces `window.twillingate`. Both instances keep sending, and they share
the same localStorage, so two projects on one page are not supported.

**Migrating from Plausible?** The collector also serves
`/js/plausible-shim.js`, an optional second tag that fires events from
Plausible's `plausible-event-*` CSS classes. A site whose CTAs are already
tagged that way keeps working without touching the markup:

```html
<script defer src="https://twillingate.example.com/js/twillingate.js"
        data-key="ak_9f3c…" data-identity="anonymous"></script>
<script defer src="https://twillingate.example.com/js/plausible-shim.js"></script>
```

Both are `defer`, so they execute in document order and the shim finds the
tracker already initialised. It also tolerates the tracker being absent
(blocked, failed to load) — clicks are ignored rather than throwing. See
[docs/plausible/](plausible/) for what it supports.

### SDK-only mode

Load the file without `data-key` (it stays dormant), or bundle
`sdk/src/twillingate.ts`, and initialise yourself:

```js
twillingate.init({
  url: "https://twillingate.example.com",  // defaults to the script's origin
  key: "ak_9f3c…",
  identity: "anonymous",       // or "identified"
  autoPageviews: true,         // default false in explicit init
  maskUrl: "uuid",
  routing: "history",
  // app analytics context, sent as batch attributes:
  platform: "web",             // → $platform
  appVersion: "2.4.1",         // → $app_version
  installId: "018f…",          // → $install_id (stable per install)
  user: "u_123",               // optional page-render identity
  group: "org_9",
});
```

### Runtime API

```js
twillingate.page();                            // $pageview for the current page
twillingate.page("/settings");                 // $pageview for an explicit path
twillingate.page((p) => ({ ab: "b" }));        // register a pageview listener
twillingate.screen("/settings");               // app $screen_view
twillingate.track("signup", { plan: "pro" });  // opt-in product event
twillingate.attrs({ tier: "beta" });           // default attributes on every event
twillingate.identify("user-123", "Ada");       // $user_id + optional $user_name
twillingate.group("org-9", "Acme Corp");       // $group_id + optional $group_name
twillingate.reset();                           // on logout — see below
twillingate.flush();                           // force-send the queue
twillingate.util.maskIds(path);                // helpers, see Masking
```

- `track(name, attrs)` — product event; don't `$`-prefix your names.
- `attrs(attrs)` — default attributes merged under every event's own (event
  attributes win). Successive calls merge; `attrs(null)` clears.
- `page(arg?, attrs?)` — no argument records the current page; a string
  records that path; an object is extra attributes for the current page.
  Passing a **function** registers a pageview listener instead.
- `identify(user, name?)` — sets `$user_id` and the optional `$user_name`,
  persisted for `identified` projects so every later event carries the
  identity. Events already sent stay unattributed: there is no retroactive
  stitching. Anonymous projects ignore the name server-side.
- `group(id, name?)` — sets `$group_id`/`$group_name`; always persisted (a
  group is an organization, not a person).
- `reset()` — **required on logout.** Without it the next person on a shared
  browser inherits the previous user's identity. Clears user, group, names
  and the visitor id.
- `screen(name, attrs?)` — app analytics; pair with `platform`, `appVersion`
  and `installId` in `init` so actives, versions and screens aggregate.

### Masking URLs

A pageview carries its location **already split**: `$host` and `$path`,
stored verbatim. The server does no URL parsing, no normalization, no case
folding. That is what lets a site report `/account/[id]/edit` while the raw
`/account/8812/edit` never leaves the browser — and it keeps the pages
breakdown from growing one row per account.

`data-mask-url` receives `location.href` and returns a URL string, which the
SDK then splits:

```
https://www.shop.example.com/account/3f8a91c2-…/edit?utm_source=news#top
  → mask  → https://www.shop.example.com/account/[id]/edit
  → split → { $host: "www.shop.example.com", $path: "/account/[id]/edit" }
```

It is resolved inside `init()`, **before the first pageview**, so the entry
page — the one most likely to carry an identifier — is covered with no
timing rules. Three value forms:

| Form | Detection | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Built-ins | every comma-separated token is `uuid`, `numeric` or `hex` | `util.maskIds(href, opts)` |
| Regexp | value starts with `/` | parsed as `/pattern/flags`; matches replaced with `[id]` |
| Function | anything else | `window[value]`, called with the href |

```html
<script defer src="https://twillingate.example.com/js/twillingate.js"
        data-key="ak_9f3c…" data-identity="anonymous"
        data-mask-url="uuid"></script>
```

The function form works because inline scripts run at parse time while the
SDK is deferred, so `window.maskPath` always exists when `init()` reads the
attribute:

```html
<script>
  function maskPath(href) { return href.replace(/\/orders\/[A-Z]{2}\d+/, "/orders/[ref]"); }
</script>
<script defer … data-mask-url="maskPath"></script>
```

`init({ maskUrl })` accepts all three plus a `RegExp` or a function
directly — values an attribute cannot carry. A string resolves through the
same code path either way, so the two entry points cannot drift.

**Campaign parameters are read from the original href before the mask
runs**, so a mask that strips or rewrites the query string cannot cost
attribution.

**Masking fails closed, loudly.** A named function that does not exist, an
unparseable regexp, a mask that throws or returns a non-string: one
`console.warn` and pageviews are **dropped** rather than sent unmasked. A
site that configured masking and typo'd an attribute must not silently ship
`/account/8812`.

#### `twillingate.util`

```js
twillingate.util.maskIds(value, opts?)      // uuid + ulid by default; { numeric, hex } opt-in
twillingate.util.withQuery(path, url, keys) // allowlisted query params, sorted
```

`maskIds` works segment by segment and is URL-aware: given an absolute URL
it masks the path **and hash** segments and never the host. Defaults replace
only shapes that are never legitimate route names — UUIDs and ULIDs. Numeric
is opt-in because `/2024/annual-report` is a real path; `hex` covers 24+
character hex blobs such as Mongo ObjectIds. Everything becomes the single
`[id]` token: what matters downstream is "this segment is an identifier".

#### Listeners

`page(fn)` registers a listener that runs for every pageview, automatic ones
included. It receives `{url, host, path, referrer, attributes}` and can
return an object to merge attributes or `false` to cancel the pageview.

**Values thread through the chain**: each listener receives the previous
one's `host` and `path`, so rules split across several calls compose instead
of clobbering each other.

```js
twillingate.page(({ path }) => ({ $path: path.replace(/^\/account\/[^/]+/, "/account/[id]") }));
twillingate.page(({ path }) => ({ $path: path.replace(/\/orders\/\d+/, "/orders/[id]") }));
// /account/88/orders/12 → /account/[id]/orders/[id]
```

- Listeners run in registration order; each sees the previous one's output.
- `url` is the **post-mask** URL, not `location.href` — handing over the raw
  href would let a mask scrub a parameter and leak it straight back.
- Returning `false` cancels; later listeners do not run.
- A listener that produces no `$path` drops the pageview, with a warning.

The entry pageview is emitted **synchronously** during `init()`, so a
listener registered afterwards cannot affect it and gets a warning saying
so. Use `data-mask-url` for anything that must cover the entry page; it is
resolved before that first pageview. (Deferring the entry pageview by a tick
was tried and reverted: an app that navigates during hydration would then
have it fire after the `pushState`, reporting the wrong location and being
deduped away.)

### Hash routing

`data-routing="hash"` for an app whose routes live in `location.hash`:

```
https://shop.example.com/app/?utm_source=news#/account/3f8a…/edit?tab=billing
  → { $host: "shop.example.com", $path: "/app/#/account/[id]/edit", $utm_source: "news" }
```

- `$path` is `pathname + hash`, with the query stripped from both.
- `hashchange` emits a pageview **in hash mode only**. In history mode a
  hash change is an in-page anchor jump (`#pricing`), and counting those
  would flood the pages breakdown with duplicates of one route.
- Dedup keys on `pathname + search + hash`, so consecutive routes register.

The `#` is retained so the client route `/app/#/settings` stays
distinguishable from the server route `/app/settings`, and the pathname
prefix is kept so two hash apps mounted at different paths stay apart.

`util.maskIds` masks hash segments too, so `data-mask-url="uuid"` covers
hash routes with no extra configuration.

### Query-string routing

`?tab=billing` routing needs no mode: `pushState` is hooked and the dedup key
already includes `location.search`, so query-only navigations fire distinct
pageviews. `$path` carries no query string by default — appending one is an
explicit opt-in, because it can detonate cardinality:

```js
twillingate.page(({ url, path }) => ({
  $path: twillingate.util.withQuery(path, url, ["tab", "view"]),
}));
// → /settings?tab=billing
```

`withQuery` appends only allowlisted parameters and **sorts them by key**,
so `?a=1&b=2` and `?b=2&a=1` do not become two rows. Allowlist only
low-cardinality parameters — never identifiers or free text.

### Transport

Events queue briefly (~1s) and flush as one batch — on the timer, once 20
events accumulate, on `flush()`, and on page unload (`pagehide` /
`visibilitychange` via `sendBeacon`; the key travels in the JSON body
because beacons cannot set headers). Every event carries a UUID and a client
timestamp.

A batch that fails to send (network down, 5xx) persists to a bounded
localStorage queue (`twillingate_queue`, 50 batches) and replays on the next
load or when the browser fires `online`. Replays dedupe server-side by event
id and keep their original timestamps. A 4xx response (bad key, bad payload)
drops the batch instead — resending it forever helps nobody.

### Privacy behaviour

- Anonymous projects: no cookies, no localStorage writes.
- Identified projects: a visitor id persists in `twillingate_visitor`;
  identity written by the removed legacy snippet (`analytics_visitor` /
  `analytics_user` / `analytics_group`) is migrated automatically — copied,
  not moved, so returning visitors keep their identity.
- The SDK is silent on localhost, `file://` URLs and automated browsers.
- Opt a device out: `localStorage.twillingate_ignore = "true"` (the legacy
  `analytics_ignore` is honoured too).

### Helpers

The collector serves helper scripts under the same `/js/` prefix and the
same day-long cache. Load one only if its problem is yours.

| URL | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/js/plausible-shim.js` | Fires events from Plausible's `plausible-event-*` classes, so a site migrating off Plausible keeps its tagged CTAs without touching the markup. See `docs/plausible/`. |

---

## The event model

Everything goes to one endpoint, `POST /ingest/events`. The event **name**
decides which family it lands in, and each family feeds a different surface:

| name | family | feeds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$pageview` | web | web dashboards (visitors, pages, hosts, referrers, countries, devices, UTM) and the `web_*` MCP tools |
| `$screen_view` | app | app dashboards (actives, screens, versions) and the `app_*` MCP tools |
| anything else | product | `product_events`, `product_attributes` |

The `$` prefix is reserved for the system. An unrecognized `$` **name** is
stored as an ordinary custom event with a warning (forward compatibility);
an unrecognized `$` **attribute key** is dropped, with a warning in the
response body.

### Web (`$pageview`)

Usually automatic: the SDK sends pageviews on load and on SPA navigations
(`pushState`, `popstate`, and `hashchange` in hash-routing mode). Send one
manually only from a non-browser client rendering web-like content.

A pageview carries its location already split — `$path` (**required**) and
`$host` — stored verbatim. Campaign parameters travel explicitly as
`$utm_source`, `$utm_medium` and `$utm_campaign`. `$referrer` is reduced to
a source name, and suppressed as a self-referral when its host matches
`$host`; with no `$host` there is nothing to compare against, so the
referrer is taken at face value.

`$path` may contain a `#` (hash routing) or a `?` (opt-in query routing).

A pageview is enriched from the connection that carried it: client IP for
country, User-Agent for browser and OS, `Origin` for the allowlist. **A
backend must not relay pageviews on behalf of other people** — every one
would be attributed to the backend's IP and User-Agent. The server cannot
detect this; it is a contract you keep.

Bot filtering applies to `$pageview` only, on the connection's User-Agent.
It never touches app or custom events, so an app whose HTTP library sends a
non-browser User-Agent is never dropped as a crawler.

### App (`$screen_view`)

Sent by native and desktop apps over the HTTP API. Context travels as
reserved attributes: `$install_id` (the app-install identifier — under
anonymous identity it is salted and rotated daily, more accurate than IP
hashing), `$screen`, `$session_id` (optional; without it sessions are
inferred from 30-minute gaps), `$platform`, `$app_version`, `$os_version`,
`$device_model`, `$locale`.

No User-Agent parsing ever happens for apps — they declare their own
context, which is why an Electron app is not misclassified as desktop
Chrome. `$platform` should be one of `ios`, `android`, `macos`, `windows`,
`linux`.

### Product (everything else)

Any other name is a custom product event. Don't `$`-prefix your own names.
Attributes are free-form; see [Attribute breakdowns](#attribute-breakdowns)
for which keys get their own column and value breakdown.

### Identity

Each project runs in one of two modes, set server-side:

| Mode | `$user_id`, `$install_id` | `$group_id` | `$user_name` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `anonymous` (default) | salted hash, salt rotates at 00:00 UTC | stored raw | **ignored** |
| `identified` | stored as given | stored raw | stored |

The actor an event is attributed to resolves as `$user_id` → `$install_id` →
a server-side hash of the connection. In `anonymous` mode the result is
hashed with a daily-rotating salt, so nothing links across days.

`$group_id` stays raw in both modes: it identifies an organization, not a
natural person, and hashing it would make dashboards unreadable for no real
privacy gain. If your groups are single-person, treat them as personal data.

`$user_name` is ignored entirely in `anonymous` mode. Storing a person's
name against a hash that rotates daily would defeat the anonymisation and
accumulate a fresh row per user per day.

**The server is always the enforcement point.** A client cannot opt a
project into storing raw identifiers.

---

## The wire format

Normative. Three independently written clients (iOS, Android, desktop) must
behave identically from this section alone.

### Endpoint

```
POST /ingest/events
```

The only ingest endpoint. There is no separate pageview, event or batch
path — a single event is a batch of one.

### Authentication

Every project has one or more **ingest keys**. The key identifies the
project, so **no payload carries a project field**.

| Client | How the key travels |
| --- | --- |
| Apps, server-side | `X-Analytics-Key: ak_…` header (preferred) |
| Browsers | `"key"` field in the JSON body |

The header wins when both are present. Browsers must use the body because
`navigator.sendBeacon` cannot set custom headers, and beacons are the only
transport that survives page unload.

An unknown key gets a plain `401` rather than a silent drop: a misconfigured
integration deserves a real error, and the response leaks nothing.

### Envelope

```jsonc
{
  "key": "ak_9f3c…",            // omit when using the header
  "attributes": {                // batch-level defaults, all optional
    "$install_id": "018f1e5a-…",
    "$user_id": "u_123",
    "$user_name": "Ada Lovelace",
    "$group_id": "org_9",
    "$group_name": "Acme Corp",
    "$session_id": "018f1e5b-…",
    "$platform": "ios",
    "$app_version": "2.4.1",
    "$os_version": "17.2",
    "$device_model": "iPhone15,2",
    "$locale": "en-US"
  },
  "events": [
    { "id": "018f1e5c-…", "ts": "2026-08-30T10:00:00Z",
      "name": "$pageview",
      "attributes": { "$host": "shop.example.com", "$path": "/account/[id]/edit",
                      "$utm_source": "newsletter",
                      "$referrer": "https://news.ycombinator.com/" } },
    { "id": "018f1e5d-…", "ts": "2026-08-30T10:00:05Z",
      "name": "$screen_view", "attributes": { "$screen": "/settings" } },
    { "id": "018f1e5e-…", "ts": "2026-08-30T10:00:09Z",

  ]
}
```

An event is `{id, ts, name, attributes}` and nothing else.

### Attribute merge

Batch-level `attributes` are defaults. Per-event `attributes` override them
**key by key**. That is the only merge rule, and it applies to system (`$`)
and ordinary keys alike.

The rule exists for offline queues. A queue flushed after a week may span an
app self-update: per-event override lets a client stamp `$app_version` on
only the events that differ, instead of grouping its queue by context before
flushing. It also lets a client stamp an ordinary attribute
(`"experiment": "variant_b"`) across a whole flush without repeating it.

### Reserved event names

| `name` | Stored as | Requires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$pageview` | web pageview | `$path` |
| `$screen_view` | app screen view | `$screen` |
| anything else | custom event | `name` |

An **unrecognized `$` name is stored as an ordinary custom event** with a
warning, never rejected. Clients update on app-store timelines while the
server updates on the operator's, so they will be out of step. Rejecting
would mean a client shipping a future `$session_start` against an older
server receives a `4xx`, which the retry rules classify as a poison batch to
drop — permanent data loss in exactly the window where forward compatibility
matters.

### Reserved attribute keys

| Group | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | `$install_id` `$user_id` `$user_name` `$group_id` `$group_name` `$session_id` |
| Environment | `$platform` `$app_version` `$os_version` `$device_model` `$locale` |
| Location | `$host` `$path` `$utm_source` `$utm_medium` `$utm_campaign` `$referrer` |
| App | `$screen` |

An **unrecognized `$` key is dropped** with a warning. It is not stored as
an ordinary attribute: keeping it would add a column to the flattened event
view for what is almost always a typo.

Location attributes are stored **verbatim**. The server does no URL parsing,
no normalization, no case folding — the client owns normalization. The
client IP and User-Agent are never stored; they are enriched into a country,
device, browser and OS name and discarded.

> **Removed in 2.0.** `$url` is no longer a reserved key. A client sending
> it gets a warning that it was ignored *and* a rejection naming `$path`.
> Send `$host` and `$path` instead, with campaign parameters as `$utm_*`.
> The `?ref=` query-parameter referrer fallback is gone with it; set
> `$referrer` explicitly.

### Timestamps and idempotency

**`ts`** is RFC 3339, UTC. Send the client's own clock reading at the moment
the event happened, not at flush time.

The server clamps `ts` to `[received − max_event_age, received + 5 minutes]`
and records the server clock separately. Out-of-range values are **clamped
and counted, never dropped**, so a device with a broken clock still
contributes. `max_event_age` equals the deployment's
`RETENTION_APP_RAW_DAYS` (30 days by default), which guarantees a clamped
event can never target a day that has already been rolled up.

**`id`** is a client-generated UUID (v7 recommended, so ids sort by time).
Supplying one is what makes at-least-once delivery safe: the write ignores a
duplicate primary key, so a batch retried after a timeout that actually
succeeded is a no-op. **Omit `id` and a replayed batch double-counts.**

### Responses and retry

```jsonc
202 {
  "accepted": 2,
  "rejected": 1,
  "errors":   [ { "index": 3, "reason": "$pageview requires $path" } ],
  "warnings": [ { "index": 1, "reason": "unknown reserved key $app_ver, ignored" } ]
}
```

`errors` and `warnings` are each capped at 10 entries. Rejection is **per
event, not per batch**: one malformed event increments `rejected` and the
rest of the batch still lands, so a single bad event cannot poison a
500-event replay.

| Code | Meaning | Client action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 202 | Accepted for processing | Do not retry |
| 400 | Malformed envelope | Drop — poison batch |
| 401 | Unknown or disabled key | Drop |
| 403 | `Origin` present and not allowed | Drop |
| 413 | Body or event count over limit | Split and retry |
| 5xx | Server fault | Retry with backoff |

**Normative: retry only on 5xx and network failure. Any other 4xx is a
poison batch — drop it.** Retrying a 400 forever is the most common way a
hand-written client turns one bug into an outage.

The `202` is returned **before** the write; the pipeline is asynchronous. So
`accepted` counts validation, not persistence, and must not be treated as a
durability receipt.

### Limits

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | 256 KB |
| Events per batch | 500 |
| Attributes per event | 50 |
| Attribute key length | 64 characters |
| Attribute value length | 512 characters (truncated, not rejected) |

### Origin and CORS

If an `Origin` header is present it must match the project's
`allowed_origins`; if absent, the request is accepted. Native apps send no
`Origin` and are unaffected.

An entry may contain `*`. A bare `*` allows any origin; elsewhere it stands
for any run of characters within the origin, so `https://*.example.com`
matches every subdomain (but not the apex, and not `http://`) and
`https://app.example.com:*` matches any port. The matched origin is echoed
back, never `*`, so a wildcard entry stays compatible with browsers that
reject a literal `*`.

Electron and Tauri renderers **do** send one, so add their scheme
(`tauri://localhost`, `app://.`, `file://`) to `allowed_origins`.

Preflight is answered with `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,
X-Analytics-Key` and echoes the matched origin. To skip preflight entirely,
send the key in the body with `Content-Type: text/plain`, which makes the
request CORS-simple.

### Worked offline queue

**On event**
1. Generate a UUIDv7 `id` and an RFC 3339 `ts` **now**.
2. Append `{id, ts, name, attributes}` to a durable local queue.

**On flush** (app foreground, network available, or a timer)
1. Take up to 500 events from the head of the queue.
2. POST them with the current context as batch-level `attributes`.
3. On `2xx` **or** any `4xx` other than 429: delete those events from the
   queue. A 4xx will never succeed on retry.
4. On `5xx`, 429, or a network error: keep them and retry with exponential
   backoff (for example 1s, 5s, 25s, capped at a few minutes).
5. On `413`: halve the batch size and retry.

**Never**
- Block the UI on a flush.
- Grow the queue without bound — cap it (say 10 000 events) and drop the
  oldest, which keeps recent data when a device is offline for a week.
- Retry a `400` or `401`.

## Answer questions with the data

A connected session gets nineteen tools. Reach for a purpose-built one
before `query` — they are cheaper, they cannot be malformed, and they
already apply the caveats below.

**Reading (all take `project`, `from`, `to` as `YYYY-MM-DD` unless noted):**

| Tool | Extra parameters | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_projects` | none | Every non-archived project, its alias and identity mode. Call this first — every other tool needs an alias |
| `web_overview` | — | Visitors, pageviews, sessions, bounces, average session length per day |
| `web_breakdown` | `dimension`, `limit` (default 20) | Top rows for one of `pages`, `hosts`, `referrers`, `countries`, `devices`, `browsers`, `os`, `utm` |
| `app_overview` | — | Actives, views, sessions, duration per day |
| `app_breakdown` | `dimension`, `limit` | One of `screens`, `versions`, `os`, `devices`, `countries` |
| `product_events` | `event` (optional filter) | Count and unique users per event name, plus daily totals |
| `product_attributes` | `event`, `key` | Value breakdowns for a declared attribute. `$platform` and `$app_version` are always available; a custom key only appears once the project declares it |
| `retention` | `surface` (`web` or `app`) | Cohort curves, plus `aggregated_through` — cohorts after that day are **absent, not zero** |
| `identities` | `kind` (`user` or `group`), `limit` | Per-user or per-group activity with display names. **Surfaces personal data on identified projects** |
| `query` | `sql` | A single read-only `SELECT`/`WITH` against the views. Row-capped and time-limited |

**Managing** — `create_project`, `update_project`, `archive_project`,
`restore_project`, `issue_ingest_key`, `list_ingest_keys`,
`enable_ingest_key`, `disable_ingest_key` and `integration_guide`, all
described in [Set up a project](#set-up-a-project).

**Resources:** `docs://twillingate` (this document), `docs://deployment`
(installing and configuring the collector itself), `schema://views` (the
authoritative column list — read it before writing SQL) and
`schema://projects` (the live registry).

Ask in plain language — "how many visitors did myapp get last week by
country", "which hosts is this project collecting from", "which screens do
people hit before they subscribe", "issue a key for the marketing site".

Enabling the endpoint, choosing an auth mode and pointing a client at it are
in [deployment.md](deployment.md#the-api-endpoint).

### HTTP API

Every tool above except `integration_guide` is also a REST route under
`/api/`, guarded by the same bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer …`) as
MCP. Send and receive JSON. `integration_guide` and the `docs://` resources
are MCP-only — there is no REST equivalent.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://t.example.com/api/projects/blog/web/overview?from=2026-09-01&to=2026-09-13"
```

| Method | Path | Mirrors | Input |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/projects` | `list_projects` | — |
| `POST` | `/api/projects` | `create_project` | body: `alias`, `name`, `identity`, `allowed_origins`, `attributes`, `skip_key` → 201 |
| `PATCH` | `/api/projects/{alias}` | `update_project` | body: fields to change (merge) |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{alias}/archive` | `archive_project` | — |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{alias}/restore` | `restore_project` | — |
| `GET` | `/api/keys` | `list_ingest_keys` | query: `project` |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{project}/keys` | `issue_ingest_key` | body: `label` → 201 |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{project}/keys/{label}/disable` | `disable_ingest_key` | — |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{project}/keys/{label}/enable` | `enable_ingest_key` | — |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{project}/web/overview` | `web_overview` | query: `from`, `to` |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{project}/web/breakdown` | `web_breakdown` | query: `from`, `to`, `dimension`, `limit` |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{project}/app/overview` | `app_overview` | query: `from`, `to` |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{project}/app/breakdown` | `app_breakdown` | query: `from`, `to`, `dimension`, `limit` |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{project}/product/events` | `product_events` | query: `from`, `to`, `event` |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{project}/product/attributes` | `product_attributes` | query: `from`, `to`, `event` |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{project}/retention` | `retention` | query: `from`, `to`, `surface` |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{project}/identities` | `identities` | query: `from`, `to`, `kind`, `limit` |
| `POST` | `/api/query` | `query` | body: `sql` |
| `GET` | `/api/schema/views` | `schema://views` | — (text/plain) |

Success is the tool's output as JSON, at 200 (201 where noted above).
Errors are `{"error":{"code":"…","message":"…"}}`: `invalid` is 400,
`not_found` is 404, `conflict` is 409, anything else is `internal` at 500.
A missing or bad token is 401. An unknown query parameter or an unknown
field in a JSON body is also 400 — the same strictness as a malformed one.
So is a query string that does not parse (a bad `%` escape, a bare `;`)
or a parameter given twice: a filter is never dropped silently.

### Writing SQL against the views

The `query` tool takes read-only SQL against the views below. It is
row-capped (`API_QUERY_MAX_ROWS`, default 1000) and time-limited
(`API_QUERY_TIMEOUT`, default `10s`).

**Read `schema://views` for the authoritative column list.** It is kept in
step with the migrations and carries the caveats that cannot be inferred
from the DDL. The three that matter most:

1. `day` columns are TEXT `'YYYY-MM-DD'` (UTC). Compare and `BETWEEN` as
   strings.
2. Every `v_*` view includes yesterday and today: each stitches aggregated
   history (`agg_*` tables) to a live half computed from raw rows.
3. **`v_retention` has no live half.** It refreshes at the 03:00 UTC daily
   pass; cohort days after that are ABSENT, not zero. It is populated only
   for projects with `identity=identified`, because anonymous visitor ids
   rotate daily and cohorts are undefined.

Every view carries a `project` column — always filter on it.

The web views are `v_web_daily`, `v_web_pages`, `v_web_hosts`,
`v_web_referrers`, `v_web_countries`, `v_web_devices`, `v_web_browsers`,
`v_web_os` and `v_web_utm`. App traffic has `v_app_daily`, `v_app_screens`,
`v_app_versions`, `v_app_os`, `v_app_devices` and `v_app_countries`. Product
events have `v_product_daily`, `v_product_totals` and `v_product_attrs`,
plus a per-project `v_events_flat` with one column per declared attribute.
`v_identity_daily` and `identities` join user and group activity to display
names.

Cost note: the views' live halves sessionize raw rows with window functions,
and a `WHERE` on `day` may not prune that work. Narrow ranges and the `agg_*`
tables are cheaper.
